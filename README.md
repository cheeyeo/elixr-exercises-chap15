OTP Stack application
================================

Example OTP application from Chapter 16 of Programming Elixir book

This is building on chapter 15 of the book whereby we create a basic OTP implementation of a stack

The difference with this version is that

* it is packaged to be run from the command line

* It uses a supervisor tree with a separate module to keep track of the state 

More information can be obtained from the book itself
